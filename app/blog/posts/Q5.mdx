1. **First, I would acknowledge the customer’s request promptly to confirm receipt and assure them that I am looking into the issue.**

2. **I would then request the customer to provide detailed information to better understand the context:**
   - Specific Error Messages
   - Screenshots or logs
   - Environment Details like OS, versions of the framework, and related tools used
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Any Recent Changes to the code or environment
   - Expected vs. Actual Outcome

3. **I would perform initial research on the unfamiliar framework or technology to gain a foundational understanding.** 
   - This includes reviewing official documentation, community forums, and any existing knowledge base articles.

4. **If possible, I would set up a similar environment to replicate the issue.** 
   - This helps in understanding the problem firsthand and testing potential solutions.

5. **I would reach out to colleagues or relevant internal teams who might have experience with the framework for insights or guidance.**

6. **If necessary, I might also engage with the framework’s support community or forums to gather additional information.**

7. **Based on the gathered information and research, I would form hypotheses about potential causes and test them systematically in the replicated environment.**

8. **Throughout the process, I would keep the customer informed of the progress and any findings.** 
   - Transparent and regular updates help in managing expectations and maintaining trust.

9. **Once a solution is identified, I would guide the customer through the resolution steps and ensure the issue is resolved to their satisfaction.**

10. **I would keep the ticket under observation until the customer confirms that the issue is resolved.**

11. **Finally, I would document the issue, troubleshooting steps, and solution in the knowledge base to assist with similar future issues and improve the team's knowledge.**
