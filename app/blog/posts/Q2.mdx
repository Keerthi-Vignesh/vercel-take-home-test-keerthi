As a senior support engineer with extensive experience, I enjoy troubleshooting customer issues, which allows me to learn and enhance my technical skills. I like conducting research and collaborating with other teams to deliver solutions that satisfy customers and reinforce their choice of the product. I take pride in creating technical documents for both internal and external use, leaving a lasting impact on the team and reducing the support team's workload. I also enjoy training my team and sharing my knowledge and experiences. I like to focus on learning new technical skills and obtaining certifications to stay current and excel in my role.
