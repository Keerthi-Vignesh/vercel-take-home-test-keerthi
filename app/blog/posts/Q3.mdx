1. **In my role at Twilio, I encountered a challenge from a customer working in a research lab where mobile phones were not allowed. The customer contacted us because the mandatory 2FA with a mobile number made it impossible for them to log in due to the lab’s no-phone policy. This restriction had previously not been an issue, but the implementation of 2FA had rendered them unable to access their console.**

2. **Understanding the critical nature of their work, I escalated the issue to my manager and then discussed it with the supportability engineering team. We explored various alternatives, including sending OTPs to email addresses or landline numbers, or bypassing the 2FA requirement entirely for this customer.**

3. **After discussing these options with the customer, they preferred receiving OTPs via email. However, due to system constraints, this was not feasible. The customer then suggested using a landline number available at their lab’s reception.**

4. **The engineering team worked on developing this new feature. Despite initial estimates of a two-week timeline, it took nearly a month due to the complexity and necessary approvals. Throughout this period, I maintained communication with the customer, providing regular updates.**

5. **The solution allowed the customer to receive OTPs through an automated call to their landline, giving them a 60-120 second window to enter the code and access their console. This successfully resolved their access issues.**

6. **The customer was satisfied with the solution, as it enabled them to continue their work without violating lab policies. I kept their ticket under observation and only closed it after receiving confirmation from the customer. They then rated my service 5/5 and sent an appreciation email.**

7. **The successful resolution of this issue not only helped the customer but also enhanced Twilio’s 2FA system to be more flexible and inclusive.**
