Hi [Customer Name],

Thank you for reaching out to us! I can help you set up a redirect from the ‘/blog’ path to ‘https://example.com’ using Vercel. Here’s how you can do it:

## Steps to Create a Redirect on Vercel:

1. Open your project in the Vercel dashboard.
2. Locate the `vercel.json` file in the root directory of your project. If you don’t have one, you can create it.
3. Add the following redirect configuration within the `vercel.json` file:

    ```json
    {
      "redirects": [
        { "source": "/me", "destination": "/profile.html", "permanent": false }
      ]
    }
    ```

4. Save and deploy your changes. This configuration ensures that any requests to `/blog` will be permanently redirected to `https://example.com`.

For more detailed information, you can refer to the Vercel documentation on [redirects](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/project-configuration#redirects) and [configuration settings](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/project-configuration).

If you are using Next.js, you can also configure redirects directly in the `next.config.js` file:

    ```js
    module.exports = {
      async redirects() {
        return [
          {
            source: '/blog',
            destination: 'https://example.com',
            permanent: true,
          },
        ];
      },
    };
    ```

Save and deploy your changes. This approach ensures that any requests to `/blog` are redirected to `https://example.com` with a permanent redirect (HTTP status code 308).

If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, please feel free to reach out. I’m here to help!

Best regards,  
Keerthi P Vignesh

**Note:**

In Vercel, there are two primary ways to configure redirects: using the `vercel.json` file and configuring them in the `next.config.js` file.

- The `vercel.json` file is a project configuration file specific to Vercel. This method is suitable for all types of projects deployed on Vercel, regardless of the framework or technology used.
- The `next.config.js` file is specific to Next.js projects only.
