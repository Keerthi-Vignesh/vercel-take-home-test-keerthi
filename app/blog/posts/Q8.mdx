Hi [Customer Name],

Thank you for reaching out! To ensure your project is not indexed by search engines while hosted on Vercel, you can utilize the ‘X-Robots-Tag’ header with the value `noindex`. This header will instruct search engines not to index your site.

## Steps to Prevent Indexing:

1. **Using `vercel.json`:**
    a. Create or update your `vercel.json` file in the root directory of your project.
    b. Add the following configuration to include the `X-Robots-Tag` header:

    ```json
    {
      "headers": [
        {
          "source": "/(.*)",
          "headers": [
            {
              "key": "X-Robots-Tag",
              "value": "noindex"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

2. **Using `next.config.js` (for Next.js projects):**
    a. Open your `next.config.js` file.
    b. Add the following configuration to set the `X-Robots-Tag` header:

    ```js
    module.exports = {
      async headers() {
        return [
          {
            source: '/(.*)',
            headers: [
              {
                key: 'X-Robots-Tag',
                value: 'noindex'
              }
            ],
          },
        ];
      },
    };
    ```

3. Commit and push your changes to your Git repository.
4. Deploy your project. Vercel will apply the new headers to your deployment, ensuring search engines do not index your site.

**Note:**

Vercel automatically adds the `X-Robots-Tag: noindex` header to preview deployments to prevent them from being indexed by search engines.

For further details, feel free to refer to the Vercel documentation on [headers](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/project-configuration#headers) and [X-Robots-Tag Header](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/project-configuration#x-robots-tag-header).
