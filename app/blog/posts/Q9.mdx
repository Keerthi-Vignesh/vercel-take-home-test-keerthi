title: '9.	What do you think is one of the most common problems which customers ask Vercel for help with? How would you help customers to overcome common problems, short-term and long-term?'

---

Based on the information gathered from Vercel’s documentation, one of the most common issues customers seek help with involves their projects not deploying or running correctly on Vercel, even when they work fine locally. This includes troubleshooting build errors, misconfigurations, routing and redirects, environment variables, and performance issues specific to the Vercel platform and the Next.js framework.

As a Senior Customer Support Engineer at Vercel, my goal would be to provide exceptional support to customers by addressing their immediate concerns while also implementing long-term strategies to prevent recurring issues. Here’s how I would achieve this:

## Short-term solutions:

1. **Promptly acknowledge customer issues, provide clear troubleshooting instructions using Vercel's resources, and encourage engagement with community forums and GitHub discussions for further support.**

2. **Thoroughly analyze the root cause of each reported issue to ensure a complete solution and prevent similar problems in the future.**

3. **Provide tailored solutions based on the customer’s specific setup and requirements.**

## Long-term solutions:

1. **Continuously update documentation based on user feedback and reported issues while developing in-depth guides and case studies to address complex scenarios, ensuring the content remains relevant and helpful.**

2. **Implement and enhance automated diagnostic tools for common issues, and establish proactive monitoring systems to identify and address potential problems before they impact customers, providing insights and recommendations based on monitoring data.**

3. **Host regular educational sessions, webinars, and workshops on best practices and new features, provide on-demand recordings, and develop certification programs to help developers gain a deep understanding of Vercel’s platform and effective usage.**
